# **LeetBank**

A clean collection of my LeetCode solutions, organized **only by problem number**.  
Each folder contains my personal solution (Java).

```

```

✔ Simple  
✔ Number-based  
✔ Easy to search  
✔ Always growing

## 🚀 **How This Repo Works**

Each problem is stored inside a folder named **only with its LeetCode problem number**.

**Example:**

```
1513/Solution.java
200/Solution.java
88/Solution.java
```

No extra files.  
No boilerplate.  
Just clean DSA code.
